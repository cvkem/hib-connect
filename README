# hib-connect

Hib-connect provides an interface between the clojure-world and a hibernate database. Hibernate is an ORM (Object Relational Model) that basically provides two functionalities:
1. A uniform interface to many different database systems (abstracting away the difference in SQL-dialects.
2. Persistant storage of (java-)objects and the relations between these objects.

The first item is my primary motivation to develop this system. The system consist of two parts:
1. A code generator that based on a name and a field definition generates:
    a. A .java file containing a class definition of the stored objects.
    b. A .map.include file that describes the hiberanate mapping.
    c. A .clj file describes the clojure interface for the objects.
2. An connector (bridge) to the hibernate work containing the sessionFactory and the code to translate objects/instances from/to clojure.
 


## Usage
Using the system basically is a n-step procedure
1. Use the vinzi.hib-connect.code-generator to generate the files describing your datastructure
2. Include the generated files in your code-base
     a. The .java files need to  be compiled to the classes folder
     b. The .map.include needs to be included in your hibernate mapping
     c. The .clj needs to be include in the 'use' or 'require' of your code.
3. The vinzi.hib-connect.bridge needs to be include in your code.

Calls to the hiberate system require a session. The session is provided by wrapping calls with 'call-in-hib-session'.
When closing the program you need to call 'close-hib' to release the database-connection.

In the file vinzi.hib-connector.demo.clj you find some examples of using the system.
